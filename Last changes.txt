20/04/2016 Changes 
- Added some functions and class for empty and full shapes (FRectangle, Disc, ...)
- Added some examples to formes.txt
- Big clean up on Shape.h and Shape.cpp (We forgot about using the key word protected which make 
attributes directly usable only by derived classes (getters setters no longer needed between subclasses,
remains for external use). Now drawshape is much simpler for line and Rectangle
- There is currently a "bug" as Full Square are drawn using Rectangle method instead of FRectangle one. Have to ask
Mr Legal why.
